issue

-----cant create appointment-----


Appointment(model) was not recognising barber+service values -- "choices not valid" or "not being recognised"

queryset was not being updated correctly
form was valid but still violated database constraint- user was null when it shouldnt have

solution:
1. queryset for barber and services based on barber_id
2. SAVE appoitnment instance before calculating end_time (end_time had to be dynamic as its start_time + duration of service)
